# Nvim Lua Setup ðŸ˜Ž

This is my super cool Nvim setup that I personally use for efficient and enjoyable coding. It includes a selection of plugins and configurations to enhance your Neovim experience.

## Features âœ¨

- **Treesitter** ðŸŒ³: A powerful parsing tool that brings advanced syntax highlighting, indentation, and code analysis capabilities to Neovim. It supports a wide range of programming languages and provides accurate contextual information.

- **Nerdtree** ðŸŒ³: A popular file system explorer that allows you to navigate and manage your project files within Neovim. It provides a convenient tree-like interface and makes it easy to open, close, and manipulate files and directories.

- **Lsp-zero** ðŸ”§: A lightweight Language Server Protocol (LSP) client for Neovim. It enables features like code completion, diagnostics, and documentation for multiple programming languages. Lsp-zero ensures a smooth development experience by integrating with language servers efficiently.
